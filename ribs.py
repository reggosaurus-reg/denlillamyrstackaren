# The offical LiTHe kod code skeleton for PyGame development.
# 2020 by Edvard ThÃ¶rnros
#
# The aim of this file is to give a collection of usable functions
# and structures to be used as a jumping off point. Feel free
# to change and distribute!
#
# Functions that start with an underscore, are probably not
# interesting to read, they are functions that build other
# more usable functions.
#
# Then again, the implementations in this file are not nessecary
# for understanding how to use them. There's some nice documentation
# if you'd rather read that! :D
