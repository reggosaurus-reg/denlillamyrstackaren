# Snake-Ribs

A simple Python code skeleton for making games. The code has documentation in
the `docs` folder, and all code that is needed to get up and running is Python,
Pygame and the two magical files we've provided.

## Getting started

First off, clone the repository and `cd` into it.

```bash
# With HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/lithekod/snake-ribs.git
cd snake-ribs
```

Running snake-ribs requires pygame, which can be installed using the following
command.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Documentation

The documentation for RIBS can be found at https://lithekod.github.io/snake-ribs/

## Running the game

RIBS comes with a sample game which you can modify to make it your own. To run it,
simply call

```bash
python3 game.py
```

To modify the game, open game.py and make your own changes.
